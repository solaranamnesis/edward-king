_An Attempt to account for the Production of a Shower of Stones, that fell in Tuscany, on the 16th of June, 1794; and to show that there are Traces of similar Events having taken place, in the highest Ages of Antiquity. In the course of which Detail is also inserted, an Account of an extraordinary Hailstone, that fell, with many others, in Cornwall, on the 20th of October, 1791._

Having received this last winter, from Sir Charles Blagden, some very curious _manuscript_ accounts, concerning a surprising shower of stones; which is said, on the testimony of several persons, to have fallen in Tuscany, on the 16th of June, 1794; --- and having also perused, with much attention, a very interesting pamphlet, written in Italian, by _Abbate Ambrose Soldani_, Professor of mathematics, in the University of Siena, containing an extraordinary and full detail of such facts as could be collected relating to this shower; the whole has appeared to me to afford such an ample field for philosophical contemplation, and also for the illustration of ancient historic facts; that (leaving the whole to rest upon such testimony as the learned Professor has already collected together; and to be supported by such further corroboration, as I am informed is likely _soon_ to arrive in England,) I cannot but think it doing some service to the cause of literature, and science, to give to the world, in the earliest instance, a short abridgement of the substance of the whole of the information; expressed in the most concise and plainest language, in which it is possible for me to convey a full and exact idea of the phænomenon.

It may be of some use, and afford satisfaction to several curious persons, to find the whole here compressed in so small a compass.

And, as I shall add my own conclusions without reserve; because the whole of the phænomenon tends greatly to confirm some ideas which I had previously been led to form, many years ago, concerning the consolidation of certain species of stone; it may open a door for further curious investigation.

And it may at least amuse, if not instruct; whilst I add a short detail of uncommon facts, recorded in ancient history, and tending to show clearly, that we are not without precedents of _similar events_ having happened, in the early ages of antiquity.

On the 16th of June, 1794, a tremendous cloud was seen in Tuscany, near Siena, and Radacofani; coming from the north, about seven o'clock in the evening; --- sending forth sparks, like rockets; --- throwing out smoke like a furnace; --- rendering violent explosions, and blasts, more like those of cannon, and of numerous muskets, than like thunder; --- and casting down to the ground hot stones: --- whilst the lightning that issued from the cloud was remarkably red; and moved with _less_ velocity than usual.

The cloud appeared of different shapes; to persons in different situations; and remained suspended a long time: but every where was plainly seen to be burning, and smoking like a furnace.

And its original height, from a variety of circumstances put together, seems to have been much above the common region of the clouds.

The testimony, concerning the falling of the stones from it, appears to be almost unquestionable: --- and is, evidently, from different persons, who had no communication with each other.

For first; the fall of four stones is precisely ascertained: one of which was of an irregular figure, with a point like that of a diamond; --- weighed five pounds and an half; --- and had a vitriolic smell. --- And another weighed three pounds and an half; --- was black on the outside, as if from smoke; --- and, internally, seemed composed of matter of the colour of ashes; --- in which were perceived small spots of metals, of gold and silver.

And, besides these, Professor Soldani of Siena, was shown about fifteen others: the surfaces of which were glazed black, like a sort of varnish; --- resisted acids; --- and were too hard to be scratched with the point of a penknife.

Signior _Andrew Montauli_, who saw the cloud, as he was travelling, described it as appearing much above the common region of the clouds; and as being clearly discerned to be on fire; --- and becoming white, by degrees; not only where it had a communication, by a sort of stream of smoke and lightning, with a neighbouring similar cloud: but also, at last, in two-third parts of its whole mass, which was originally black. And yet he took notice, that it was not affected by the rays of the sun, though they shone full on its lower parts. --- And he could discern as it were the bason of a fiery furnace, in the cloud, having a whirling motion.

This curious observer gives an account also, of a stone, which he was assured fell from the cloud, at the feet of a farmer; and was dug out of the ground, into which it had penetrated. --- And he says, that it was about five inches long, and four broad; nearly square; and polished: black on the surface, as if smoked; but within, like a sort of sand-stone, with various small particles of iron, and bright metallic stars.

Other stones are described by him; which were said to have fallen at the same time: were triangular; and terminated in a sort of (pyramidal) or conical figure. --- And others were so small as to weigh not more than an ounce.

Professor Soldani saw another stone, said to have fallen from the cloud, which had the figure of a parallelopiped, blunted at the angles; and was as it were varnished, on the outside, with a black crust; and quite unlike any stones whatever of the soil of the country where it had fallen.

Two ladies being at _Cozone_, about 20 miles from _Siena_, saw a number of stones fall, with a great noise, in a neighbouring meadow: one of which, being soon after taken up by a young woman, burnt her hand: another burnt a countryman's hat: and a third was said to strike off the branch of a mulberry tree; and to cause the tree to wither.

Another stone, of about two ounces weight, fell near a girl watching sheep; a young person, whose veracity it is said could not be doubted. --- This stone, the Professor tells us, is also a parallelopiped, with the angles rounded; and its internal substance is like that of the others; only with more metallic spots; especially when viewed with a magnifying glass: and the black external crust appears to be minutely crystallized.

Many others, of a similar kind, were in the possession of different persons at Siena.

And besides the falling of these from the cloud, there is described to have been a fall of sand; seen by keepers of cattle near _Cozone_, together with the falling of what appeared like squibs; and which proved afterwards to be stones, of the sort just described, weighing two or three ounces: --- and some only a quarter of an ounce.

Amongst other stones that fell; was one weighing two pounds, and two ounces; which was also an oblong parallelopiped, with blunted angles, (as they are called, but which I think meant plainly prismatical terminations, and are said to have been about an inch in height;) and this was most remarkable for having, a small circle, or sort of belt round it, in one part; wherein the black crust appeared more smooth; and shining like glass; as if that part had suffered a greater degree of heat than the rest.

Another, also, was no less remarkable, for having many rounded cavities on its surface: as if the stone had been struck with small balls, whilst it was forming; and before it was hardened; which left their impressions. --- And some appearances, of the same kind, were found on one of the four surfaces of another stone, in the possession of Soldani.

On minute examination, the Professor found the stones were composed of blackish _crystals_, of different kinds; with metallic or pyritical spots, all united together by a kind of consolidated ashes. --- And, on polishing them, they appeared to have a ground of a dark ash colour; intermixed with cubical blackish crystals, and shining pyritical specks, of a silver and gold colour.

The conclusion which Professor Soldani evidently forms, is; _that the stones were generated in the air, by a combination of mineral substances, which had risen somewhere or other_, **as exhalations**, _from the earth_: but, as he seems to think, _not from_ Vesuvius.

The names of many persons, besides those already referred to, are mentioned; who were eye witnesses to the fall of the stones. And several _depositions_ were made, _in a regular juridical manner_, to ascertain the truth of the facts.

The space of ground, within which the stones fell, was from three to four miles.

The falling of them, was _the very day after_ the great eruption of Vesuvius.

And the distance of the place, from Vesuvius, could not be less than two hundred miles, and seems to have been more.

Vesuvius is situated _to the south_ of the spot: and the cloud came _from the north_; about thirteen, or at most eighteen hours, after the eruption.

Now, putting all these circumstances together, I cannot but venture to form a conclusion, somewhat different from Professor Soldani's; though perfectly agreeing with his general principles.

From a course of observations, and inquiries, which I have been led to pursue, for a great many years: tending to elucidate the history of extraneous fossils, and of the deluge; I have long been convinced, that stones in general, and strata of rocks, of all kinds, have been formed by _two_ very different operations of those elements, which the wisdom, and omnipotent hand of God, has ordained, and created.

The one, by means of fire: --- and the other, by means of water.

And, of each sort, there are two subdivisions.

Of the stones, and rocks, formed by fire; --- there are some, (besides lavas,) whose component parts, having been previously fused, and in a melted state, did merely cool, and harden _gradually_.

And there are others; whose component parts, having been fused, and in a melted state, and having so become completely liquid; did instantly, by the operation of the powers of _attraction_, become crystallized.

And, in like manner; of stones, and of strata of rocks, formed by means of water; --- there are some, which having had their component parts brought together, in a fluid state; did then merely become gradually settled; and by the power of attraction, and the mixture of crystalline particles, were hardened by degrees.

And there are others: which, having had their component parts, in like manner, brought together by water, did yet, on account of the peculiar nature, and more powerful _attraction_ of those parts, _instantly_ crystallize.

And both of stones, and of strata of rocks, formed by fire; and of stones, and of strata of rocks formed by means of water; there are some such, as have been slowly consolidated by the first kind of operation; namely by the gradual cooling or settling of the substances; which yet do contain imbedded in them, crystals formed by the latter kind of operation.

Instances of which, we seem to have, in some granites, on the one hand; --- and in some sorts of limestones on the other.

To this I must add also; that there appear further, to have been some stones formed _by a sort of precipitation_: much in the same manner as _Grew_ describes* the kernels, and stones of fruit to have been hardened.

And I have met with many instances, wherein it appears unquestionably, that all these kind of processes in nature are going on continually: and that extraneous substances are actually inclosed, and _continually inclosing_, which could not be _antediluvian_; but must have been _recent_.

To these short premises, I must beg leave to add; that in two papers formerly printed in the Philosophical Transactions,* I endeavoured, by some very remarkable instances, to prove, that iron, wherever it comes into combination with any substances that are tending to consolidation, _hastens the process exceedingly_; --- and also renders the hardness of the body much greater.

And I have also endeavoured, elsewhere,* to show, in consequence of conclusions deduced from experiments of the most unquestionable authority, that _air_, in its various shapes and modifications, is indeed _itself_ the great consolidating fluid, out of which solid bodies are composed; and by means of which the various attractions take place, which form all the hard bodies, and visible substances upon earth.

From all these premises then, it was impossible for me not to be led to conclude; that we have, in this august phænomenon of the fall of stones from the clouds, in Tuscany, an obvious proof, as it were before our eyes, of the combined operation of those very powers, and processes, to which I have been alluding.

It is well known; that pyrites, which are composed of iron, and sulphur, and other adventitious matter, when laid in heaps, and moistened, will take fire.

*) In his Anatomy of Plants, p. 41-184.

*) Vol. 63. p. 241 --- and Vol. 69. p. 35.

*) In the Morsels of Criticism, p. 103.

It is also well known, that a mixture of pyrites of almost any kind, beaten small, and mixed with iron filings and water, when buried in the ground will take fire; and produce a sort of artificial volcano. And, surely then, wherever a vast quantity of such kind of matter should at any time become mixed together, as flying dust, or ashes; and be by any means condensed together, or compressed, the same effect might be produced, even in the atmosphere and air.

Instead, therefore, of having recourse to the supposition, of the cloud in Tuscany having been produced by any other kind of exhalations from the earth; we may venture to believe, that an immense cloud of ashes, mixed with pyritical dust, and with numerous particles of iron, having been projected from Vesuvius to a most prodigious height, became afterwards condensed in its descent; --- took fire, both of itself, as well as by means of the electric fluid it contained; --- produced many explosions; --- melted the pyritical, and metallic, and argillaceous particles, of which the ashes were composed; --- and, by this means, had a sudden crystallization, and consolidation of those particles taken place, which formed the stones of various sizes, that fell to the ground: _but did not harden the clayey ashes so rapidly as the metallic particles crystallized_; and, therefore, gave an opportunity for _impressions to be made_ on the surfaces of some of the stones, as they fell, by means of the impinging of the others.

Nor does it appear to me, to be any solid objection to this conclusion, either that Vesuvius was so far distant; or that the cloud came from the north.

For, if we examine Sir William Hamilton's account of the very eruption in question,* we shall find, that he had reason to conclude, that the _pine-like_ cloud of ashes projected from Vesuvius, at one part of the time during this eruption, was twenty-five or thirty miles in height; and, if to this conclusion we add, not only that some ashes actually were carried to a greater distance than _two hundred miles_*; but that, when any substance is at a vast height in the atmosphere, a very small variation of the direction of its course, causes a most prodigious variation in the extent of the range of ground where it shall fall; (just as the least variation in the angle, at the vertex of an _isosceles_ triangle, causes a very great alteration in the extent of its base;) we may easily perceive, not only the possibility, but the probability, that the ashes in question, projected to so vast an height, were first carried even beyond _Siena_ in Tuscany, northward; and then brought back, by a contrary current of wind, in the direction in which they fell.

*) In the Philos. Trans. for 1795, p. 91, 92.

*) This is mentioned by Sir William Hamilton himself, p. 105.

Sir William Hamilton himself formed somewhat this sort of conclusion, on receiving the first intimation of this shower of stones from the Earl of Bristol.*

*) See Philos. Trans. for 1795, p. 104, 105.

I cannot therefore but allow my own conclusion to carry conviction with it to my own mind; and to send it forth into the world; as a ground, at least, for speculation, and reflection, to the minds of others.

That ashes, and sand, and pyritical and sulphureous dust, mixed with metallic particles from volcanoes; fit for the instantaneous crystallization, and consolidation of such bodies as we have been describing, are often actually floating in the atmosphere, at incredible distances from volcanoes, and more frequently than the world are at all aware of, is manifest from several well attested facts.

On the 26th of December, 1631, Captain _Badily_, being in the Gulf of Volo, in the Archipelago, riding at anchor, about ten o'clock at night, it began to rain _sand_ and _ashes_; and continued to do so till two o'clock the next morning. The ashes lay about two inches thick on the deck: so that they cast them overboard just as they had done snow the day before. There was no wind stirring, when the ashes fell: and yet this extraordinary shower was not confined merely to the place where _Badily_'s ship was*; but, as it appeared afterwards, was extended so widely to other parts, that ships coming from _St. John d'Acre_ to that port, being at the distance of _one hundred leagues_ from thence, were covered with the same sort of ashes. And no possible account could be given of them, except that they might come from Vesuvius.

*) See Lowthorp's Abridgement of the Philos. Trans. Vol. 2. p. 143.

On the 23rd of October, 1755, a ship belonging to a merchant of Leith, bound for Charles Town, in Carolina, being betwixt Shetland and Iceland, and about twenty-five leagues distant from the former, and therefore about three hundred miles from the latter, a shower of dust fell in the night upon the decks.*

*) Philos. Trans. Vol. 49. p. 510.

In October, 1762, at _Detroit_, in America, was a most surprising darkness, from day-break till four in the afternoon, during which time some rain falling, brought down, with the drops, sulphur and dirt; which rendered white paper black, and when burned fizzed like wet gunpowder:* and whence such matter could originally be brought, appeared to be past all conjecture, unless it came so far off as from the volcano in Guadaloupe.

*) Philos. Trans. Vol. 53. p. 54.

Condamine says, the ashes of the volcano of _Sangay_, in South America, sometimes pass over the provinces of Maca, and Quito; and are even carried as far as Guayaquil.*

*) Condamine's Journal, p. 57.

And Hooke says,* that on occasion of a great explosion from a volcano, in the island of Ternata, in the East Indies, there followed so great a darkness, that the inhabitants could not see each other the next day: and he justly leads us to infer what an immense quantity of ashes must, by this means, have been showered down somewhere on the sea; because at _Mindanao_, an hundred miles off, all the land was covered with ashes a foot thick.

*) In his Experiments, p. 35.

And now, I must add; that such kind of _falling of stones from the clouds_, as has been described to have happened in Tuscany, seems to have happened also in very remote ages, of which we are not without sufficient testimony; and such as well deserves to be allowed and considered, on the present occasion; although the knowledge of the facts was, at first, in days of ignorance and gross darkness, soon perverted to the very worst purposes.

In the Acts of the holy Apostles, we read, that the chief magistrate, at _Ephesus_, begun his harangue to the people, by saying, "Ye men of Ephesus, _what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the_ **image** _which fell down from Jupiter_?" (or rather, as the original Greek has it) "_of_ **that** _which fell down from Jupiter_?" And the learned _Greaves_ leads us to conclude this image of Diana to have been nothing but _a conical, or pyramidal stone_, that fell from the clouds. For he tells us,* on unquestionable authorities, that many others of the images of heathen deities were merely such.

*) Pyramidographia, Vol. 1. 89-91.

Herodian expressly declares,* that the Phoenicians had no statue of the sun, polished by hand, to express an image; but only had a certain _great stone, circular below, and ending with a sharpness above, in the figure of a cone, of black colour. And they report it to have fallen from heaven, and to be the image of the sun_.

*) Lib. 5.

So Tacitus says,* that at Cyprus, _the image of Venus was not of human shape; but a figure rising continually round, from a larger bottom to a small top, in conical fashion_. And it is to be remarked, that _Maximus Tyrius_ (who perhaps was a more accurate mathematician,) says, the stone was _pyramidal_.

*) Lib. 2.

And in Corinth, we are told by _Pausanias_,* that the images both of _Jupiter Melichius_, and of _Diana_, were made (if made at all by hand) with little or no art. The former being represented by a pyramid, the latter by a column.

*) In his Corinthiaca.

_Clemens Alexandrinus_ was so well acquainted with these facts, that he even concludes* the worship of such stones to have been the first, and earliest idolatry, in the world.

*) Clem. Alex. lib. 1. --- Stromatum.

It is hard to conceive how mankind should ever have been led to so accursed an abomination, as the worship of stocks, and stones, at all: but, as far as any thing so horrid is to be accounted for, there is no way so likely of rendering a possible account; as that of concluding, that some of these pyramidal stones, at least, like the image of _Diana_, actually did fall, in the earliest ages, from the clouds; in the same manner as these pyramidal stones fell, in 1794, in Tuscany.

_Plutarch_, it is well known, mentions* a stone which formerly fell from the clouds, in _Thrace_, and which _Anaxagoras_ fancied* to have fallen from the sun.

*) In Vita Lysandri.

*) Diogenes in Anaxag.

And it is very remarkable, that the old writer, from whom Plutarch had his account, described the cloud, from which this stone was said to fall, in a manner (if we only make some allowance for a little exaggeration in barbarous ages,) very similar to _Soldani's_ account of the cloud in Tuscany. --- It hovered about for a long time; seemed to throw out splinters, which flew about, like wandering stars, before they fell; and at last it cast down to the earth a stone of extraordinary size.

Pliny,* who tells us that not only the remembrance of this event, but that the stone itself was preserved to his days, says, it was of a dark burnt colour. And though he does indeed speak of it as being of an extravagant weight and size, in which circumstance perhaps he was misled: yet he mentions _another_ of a moderate size, which fell in _Abydos_, and was become an object of idolatrous worship in that place; as was still _another_, of the same sort, at _Potidæa_.

*) Historia Nat. lib. 2. cap. 59.

_Livy_, who like _Herodotus_, has been oftentimes censured as too credulous, and as a relater of falsehoods, for preserving traditions of _an extraordinary kind_; which, after all, in ages of more enlarged information, have proved to have been founded in truth; describes* a fall of stones to have happened on mount _Alba_, during the reign of _Tullus Hostilius_, (that is about 652 years before the Christian era), in words that exactly convey an idea of just such a phænomenon, as this which has so lately been observed in Tuscany.

*) Lib. 1. Sec. 31.

He says, the senate were told, that _lapidibus pluisse_, it had rained stones. And, when they doubted of the fact; and sent to inquire; they were assured that stones had actually fallen; and had fallen just as hail does, which is concreted in a storm.*

*) Haud aliter quam quum grandinem venti glomeratam in terras agunt, crebri cecidere cœlo lapides.

He mentions also shortly another shower of stones,* A. C. 202, and still a third,* which must have happened about the year 194 before the Christian era.

*) Lib. 30. Sec. 28.

*) Lib. 34. Sec. 45.

Such are the records of ancient history. And in Holy Writ also a remembrance of similar events is preserved.

For when the royal Psalmist says,* "_The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hail-stones_, **and coals of fire**," -- the latter expression, in consistency with common sense, and conformably to the right meaning of language, cannot but allude to some such phænomenon as we have been describing. And especially, as in the cautious translation of the seventy, a Greek word is used, which decidedly means _real hard substances made red hot_; and not mere appearances of fire or flame.

*) Psalm 18. v. 13.

Whilst therefore, with the same sacred writer,* we should be led to consider all these powerful operations, as the works of God; _Who casteth forth bis ice like morsels_;* and should be led to consider "_fire and hail, snow and vapours, wind and storm as fulfilling his word_*"; we should also be led to perceive, that the objections to Holy Writ, founded on a supposed _impossibility_ of the truth of what is written in the book of _Joshua_,* concerning the stones that fell from heaven, on the army of the Canaanites; are only founded in ignorance, and error.

*) Psalm 148. v. 8.

*) Psalm 147. v. 17.

*) Psalm 148. v. 8.

*) Joshua, ch. 10. v. 11.

And much more should we be led to do so; when, to these observations, and testimonies, concerning showers of hot burning stones, is added the consideration; that within the short period of our own lives, incredibly large _real hail-stones_, formed of consolidated ice; --- _of ice consolidated in the atmosphere_, have fallen both in France, and in England.

In France, on the 13th of July in the year 1788; --- of which it is well known there has been a printed account: and concerning which it is said, and has been confirmed, on good authority, that some of the stones weighed three pounds: whilst others have been said to weigh even five pounds.

And in England, on the 20th of October, 1791, in Cornwall.

Of one of the hail-stones of this latter, minor storm, I have had an opportunity of obtaining, by the favour of a friend, an exact model in glass; whereof I now add an engraving.

This stone fell, with thousands of others of the same kind, near _Menabilly_, the seat of _Philip Rashleigh_, Esq.; well known for his science, and attention to whatever is curious; who having great copper works, and many ingenious miners, and workmen, on his estate, and directly under his eye; caused it to be instantly picked up: and having then, himself, first traced both its top, and bottom, upon paper; and having measured its thickness in every part, with a pair of compasses; caused a very exact mould to be formed: and afterwards, in that mould, had this model cast in glass: wherein, also, the appearances of the imbedded, common, small, roundish hail-stones, are seen transparently; just as they appeared in the great hail-stone itself originally.

Fig. 1, is a representation of the flat bottom of the stone.

Fig. 2, is a representation of the top of the stone.

And Fig. 3, shows the whole solid appearance sideways.

Whilst Mr. Rashleigh was taking the measures, it melted so fast, that he could not, in the end, take the _exact weight_, as he fully intended to have done. But as this model in glass weighs exactly 1 ounce, 16 pennyweights, 23 grains, we may fairly conclude, that the hail-stone itself weighed much above half an ounce.

For it is well known, that the specific gravity of common glass, of which sort this model is made, is to that of water, as 2.620 to 1.000. And the specific gravity of common water, is to ice, as 8 to 7.* --- And computing according to this standard, I make the exact weight of the hail-stone to have been 295 grains.

*) Hooke's Experiments, p. 134.

From the singular manner in which the small, prior, common hail-stones appear to have been imbedded in this larger one, whilst they were falling to the earth; there is reason to be convinced, that it was formed in the atmosphere, by a sudden extraordinary congelation _almost instantaneously_, out of rain suddenly condensed, which was mingled with the common hail.

And it was very remarkable, that its dissolution, and melting, also, was much more rapid than that of the common small white hail-stones: as was the case, in like manner, with the other numerous large ones.

Perhaps it ought to be here added: --- that on the 18th of May, in the year 1680, some hail-stones are recorded to have fallen in London, near _Gresham college_, which were seen and examined by the celebrated _Dr. Hooke_; and were some of them not less than two inches over, and others three inches.

This which fell in Cornwall was only about one inch and three quarters long; an inch, or in some parts an inch and a quarter broad; and between half an inch, and three quarters of an inch thick. And its weight was near an ounce. --- How much more tremendous then were those others, that have been described as having fallen in France? --- the accounts of some of them may very probably have been exaggerated: but the reality was nevertheless as wonderful, surely, as any thing related concerning the ages of antiquity.

A proneness to credulity is ever blameable. And it is very possible, that sometimes, in a very wonderful narration, a jest may be intended to be palmed upon the world, instead of any elucidation of truth. --- But facts, _positively affirmed_, should be hearkened to with patience: and, at least, so far recorded, as to give an opportunity of verifying whether similar events do afterwards happen; and of comparing such events one with another.

To what has been said, therefore, concerning the fall of stones in Tuscany, and concerning these strange showers of hail, in France, and in England, it might perhaps too justly be deemed an unwarrantable omission, on this occasion, not to mention the very strange faet that is affirmed to have happened the last year, near _the Wold Cottage_ in Yorkshire.

I leave the fact to rest on the support of the testimonies referred to in the printed paper, which is in so many persons' hands; and that is given to those who have the curiosity to examine the stone itself, now exhibiting in London; --- and shall only relate the substance of the account shortly, as it is given to us.

In the afternoon of the 13th of December, 1795, near the Wold Cottage, noises were heard in the air, by various persons, like the report of a pistol; or of guns at a distance at sea; though there was neither any thunder or lightning at the time: --- two distinct concussions of the earth were said to be perceived: --- and an hissing noise, was also affirmed to be heard by other persons, as of something passing through the air; --- and a labouring man plainly saw (as we are told) that something was so passing; and beheld a stone, as it seemed, at last, (about ten yards, or thirty feet, distant from the ground) descending, and striking into the ground, which flew up all about him: and, in falling, sparks of fire, seemed to fly from it.

Afterwards he went to the place, in company with others, who had witnessed part of the phænomena, and dug the stone up from the place, where it was buried about twenty-one inches deep.

It smelt, (as it is said,) very strongly of sulphur, when it was dug up: and was even warm, and smoked: --- it was found to be thirty inches in length, and twenty-eight and a half inches in breadth. And it weighed fifty-six pounds.

Such is the account. --- I affirm nothing. --- Neither do I pretend either absolutely to believe: or to disbelieve. --- I have not an opportunity to examine the whole of the evidence. --- But it may be examined: and so I leave it to be.

This, however, I will say: that _first_ I saw a fragment of this stone; which had come into the hands of Sir Charles Blagden, from the Duke of Leeds: and afterwards I saw the stone itself. --- That it plainly had a dark, black crust; with several concave impressions on the outside, which must have been made before it was quite hardened; just like what is related concerning the crusts of those stones that fell in Italy. --- That its substance was not _properly of a granite kind_, as described in the printed paper; but a sort of _grit stone_; composed (somewhat like the stones said to have fallen in Italy) of sand and ashes. --- That it contained very many particles, obviously of the appearance of gold, and silver, and iron; (or rather more truly of _pyrites_). --- That there were also several small rusty specks; probably from decomposed pyrites; --- and some striated marks; --- that it does not effervesce with acids; --- and that, as far as I have ever seen, or known, or have been able to obtain any information, no _such_ stone has ever been found, before this time, in Yorkshire; or in any part of England. Nor can I easily conceive that such a species of stone could be formed, by art, to impose upon the public.

Whether, therefore, it might, or might not, possibly be the effect of ashes flung out from _Heckla_, and wafted to England; like those flung out from Vesuvius, and (as I am disposed to believe) wafted to Tuscany, I have nothing to affirm.

I wish to be understood to preserve mere records, the full authority for which, deserves to be investigated more and more.
